# Rockbuster Stealth  

## Introduction. 
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores all over the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, Rockbuster Stealth planed to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive.
As a Data Analyst in the Business Intelligence (BI) department of Rockbuster Stealth, I used SQL to analyze data and answer specific business questions that other departments had while developing a strategy for launching a new online video service.  
   
   ## Key Questions and Objectives  
   The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expected data-driven answers that they could use for their 2020 company strategy.  
   Here are the main questions they’d like to answer: 
   
*- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?*  
*- What was the average rental duration for all videos?*  
*- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?*  
*- Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?*  
*- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?*
